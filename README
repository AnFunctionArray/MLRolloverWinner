This project is about winning.

You play against a simple SHA-512 algo that generate rollover with different values based on input server seed and client seed and nonce. Over long-term you are in profit.

You need several "addons":

And of-course the torch C++ library - prefered CPU version it's faster with Intel CPU (but you can utilise CUDA too - however it would be slower).
And if you want to to plug yourself online against certain provider you could if you install bun.exe and fix several paths inside the example-app.cpp file (and api keys inside the mjs files).

However the online version is very slow (I was thinking about optimizations - where I start an bun.exe instance and just wait for "input" from a pipe after each bet so connections don't get reset each time).

I'm building with Visual Studio 2022 for Windows with C++.

You can set REAL_BAL to false or true depending if you want to play online. And also DEF_BET_AMNT to the base bet amount of currency in play (which if you play online you need to adjust in the JS files too - it's currently ETC).

I'm open to cleaning code pull-requests.
